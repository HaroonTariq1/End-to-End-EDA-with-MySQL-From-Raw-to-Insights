# layoffs-data-cleaning
SQL project to clean and prepare 2022 layoffs dataset for analysis using MySQL.
## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source**: [Layoffs Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)
- Contains data on tech company layoffs from 2020â€“2023, including:
  - Company name
  - Industry
  - Location
  - Number of layoffs
  - Funding stage
  - Percentage laid off
  - Date of layoffs
  - ## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Steps

Hereâ€™s what I did in the `layoffs_data_cleaning.sql` file:

1. **Removed duplicates**
   - Used `ROW_NUMBER()` to find and delete true duplicates.

2. **Standardized values**
   - Changed "CryptoCurrency", "Crypto Currency" â†’ "Crypto"
   - Fixed "United States." â†’ "United States"
   - Fixed `industry` and `country` inconsistencies

3. **Handled missing data**
   - Filled missing `industry` values based on matching company names
   - Left some nulls for better EDA later (like in layoffs count)

4. **Fixed date format**
   - Converted date column from text to `DATE` type using `STR_TO_DATE()`

5. **Dropped irrelevant rows**
   - Removed rows with no layoff info (both `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off` were null)
  
   - # End-to-End EDA with MySQL: From Raw Layoff Data to Insights

This project walks through a complete data analysis pipeline using SQL â€” from cleaning raw layoff records to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) directly in MySQL.

The dataset includes records of company layoffs, dates, employee counts, and more. Using SQL, we cleaned the data, handled nulls/duplicates, and uncovered trends across companies, industries, and time periods.

   - ## ðŸ’» Tools Used
- **SQL Dialect**: MySQL
- **Platform**: MySQL Workbench
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Layoffs 2022
